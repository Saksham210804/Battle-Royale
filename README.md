# Fast-Paced Semi-3D Shooter Game

This Unity project is a fast-paced semi-3D shooter game developed as part of an internship assignment. It features a tight level layout designed to test movement, shooting precision, and player awareness, all within a dynamic and reactive environment. The game combines platforming with intense wave-based enemy encounters, offering an engaging experience from start to finish.

The core of the gameplay revolves around fluid character movement and combat. The player can run, jump, and even wall run and wall jump to navigate the environment. These mechanics are supported by responsive physics and a clean control system. A key feature of the game is its camera switch mechanism: by pressing the TAB key, players can seamlessly toggle between first-person and third-person perspectives, allowing them to adapt their view depending on the situation.

Enemy AI in the game is built using Unity’s NavMesh system. Enemies detect the player and navigate toward them intelligently, attacking in waves that increase in difficulty. These enemies are not passive—they shoot back, forcing players to stay alert, find cover, and react quickly. The game begins with a limited number of enemies and spawns additional waves over time, encouraging a fast and aggressive playstyle.

The UI system includes player health, score, and high score is also saved using PlayerPref inside Unity, giving a complete arcade-style shooter feel. A high-energy background track complements the gameplay, enhancing the tension and pace of each encounter. The UI updates dynamically as players progress through the waves, showing kills and remaining health.

Overall, the game delivers an intense shooting experience with reactive enemy AI, clean movement, atmospheric sound, and smart level design—all tailored to demonstrate gameplay mechanics clearly and effectively.
